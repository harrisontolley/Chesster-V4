Chesster V4.

Ignore the previous 3 attempts at making anything half decent (it still isn't!). 

To host a local server to query from:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 server.py
```

Navigate to [ChessterWeb](https://github.com/harrisontolley/ChessterWeb), and clone the repository. 

Then start the local ChessterWeb app using:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
